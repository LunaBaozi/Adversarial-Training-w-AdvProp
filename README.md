# Adversarial-Training-w-AdvProp
Colab Notebook for the Advanced Computer Vision project focused on experiments with the AdvProp framework for adversarial training of DNNs

# Reference paper
The work is based on the paper "Adversarial Examples Improve Image Recognition" by Xie et al. (CVPR 2020): (https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09665).

# Overview
We use the EfficientNet implementation of (https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/blob/master/ML/Pytorch/CNN_architectures/pytorch_efficientnet.py) on top of which we built experiments with different Batch Norm layers and second-order adversarial attacks for testing both accuracy and robustness of the deep neural networks.
